# DHT_to_openhab
Script to gather temp and humidity from my DHT sensors and post to my openhab implementation

This currently requires the setup that I employ on my systems where a ".config" and "bin" directory are children of the home directory:

~
~/.config
~/bin

and the yaml file goes in the ~/.config directory.
